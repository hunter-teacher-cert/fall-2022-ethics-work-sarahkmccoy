# Algorithm

This is a difficult question, because the airline is operating to maximize profits, not provide comfortable service to the population at large.  It would be a strange business model if paying for better service is considered unethical.  The programmer would have to be working to maximize profits...how can they do that while not being horrible?  Hmmm...

Maybe there could be a cascading preference. The party booking would be able to input the ages of their family group, preferred number of people sitting together, and the number of people that absolutely had to be seated together.  They could be required to pay a reasonable fee for more than 2 people, taking into account that it is unlikely that one mother would have more than 2 children of an age that they couldn't sit alone.

More generally, the programmer might consider young children.  They should always be seated with at least
one adult in their party.  The algorithm should have an variable for whether a passenger is below a certain age, that is attached to who they were booked with, and assign these pairs before the random-assignment stage.

Ideally, parties that book together should be kept together when possible; an algorithm that 
searches for the required number of adjacent seats or seats in adjacent rows would reduce 
anxiety for groups. It would also allow greater flexibility for people to switch seats according 
to need within that group. If this is impossible, then people should be grouped with at least 
one other party member if possible so that no one party member is separated from the rest.

# Impact on Equity

I realize that my thinking is not taking into account other types of disability, such as old age, sickness, or other disabilities.

Honestly, I believe that most these sorts of issues are sorted out by the attendants around boarding time, and most people are happy to give up their seats to accomodate small children or disabilities.
